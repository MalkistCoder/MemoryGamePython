# Memory Game
Made by [Malkist](https://malkist.dev/).

I made this because my friend wanted me to code one of these for some reason. I just coded up a memory game that is most likely tons of lines longer than it should be.

Requires the `colorama` module for a splash of color.

## How to Run

First, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already.

Then, use `pip` to install the `colorama` module.

Go to the Command Prompt app on Windows, or Terminal on Mac, and type:

```shell
pip install colorama
```

Then, run the `main.py` file.

```shell
cd /path/to/MemoryGamePython
python main.py
```
